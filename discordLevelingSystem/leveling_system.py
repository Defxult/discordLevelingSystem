    ----------

        The amount of messages each member can send before the cooldown triggers

    per: :class:`float`
        The amount of seconds each member has to wait before gaining more XP, aka the cooldown
    
    awards: Optional[Dict[:class:`int`, List[:class:`RoleAward`]]]
        The role given to a member when they reach a :class:`RoleAward` level requirement

    Kwargs
    ------
    no_xp_roles: Sequence[:class:`int`]
        A sequence of role ID's. Any member with any of those roles will not gain XP when sending messages (defaults to :class:`None`)
    
    no_xp_channels: Sequence[:class:`int`]
        A sequence of text channel ID's. Any member sending messages in any of those text channels will not gain XP (defaults to :class:`None`)
    
    announce_level_up: :class:`bool`
        If `True`, level up messages will be sent when a member levels up (defaults to `True`)

    stack_awards: :class:`bool`
        If this is `True`, when the member levels up the assigned role award will be applied. If `False`, the previous role award will be removed
        and the level up assigned role will also be applied (defaults to `True`)

    level_up_announcement: Union[:class:`LevelUpAnnouncement`, Sequence[:class:`LevelUpAnnouncement`]]
        The message that is sent when someone levels up. If this is a list of :class:`LevelUpAnnouncement`, one is selected at random (defaults to :class:`LevelUpAnnouncement()`)
    
    bot: Union[:class:`discord.ext.commands.AutoShardedBot`, :class:`discord.ext.commands.Bot`]
        Your bot instance variable. Used only if you'd like to use the `on_dls_level_up` event (defaults to :class:`None`)
